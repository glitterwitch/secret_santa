required environment variables (put them in .env and foreman will pick them up:)

FROM_EMAIL: the "from" address on the email to be sent out
FROM_NAME: the "full name" on the email to be sent out
EMAIL_SUBJECT: the subject line on the email to be sent out
GMAIL_USER: The Gmail username to send the email from
GMAIL_PASS: The Gmail password for the account you will send the email from. If you have 2fa (recommended!), you will need to generate an app-specific password for this.

Usage:
----

1. create a 'people' CSV file with the following fields (no header):

  ID,NAME,ADDRESS,EMAIL ADDRESS,DETAILS,EXCLUSIONS

  the "DETAILS" field will generally contain a mailing address but can include other instructions. HTML <br> tags are supported.
  the "EXCLUSIONS" field should be a semicolon-separated list of ids (from the first column) signifying people that the person should not be assigned to give a gift to.

2. create a 'template' text file. Use the following %%DOUBLE_PERCENT_DELIMITED%% variable names in the template to substitute the specifics for a given email to a particular person:

  %%NAME%%: used to address the person receiving the email
  %%GIVING_TO%%: used to give the name of the person they're giving a gift to
  %%ADDRESS%%: giftee's mailing address
  %%DETAILS%%: the DETAILS field from the CSV (most likely gift hints)


3. You can test the assignments via `bundle exec rake test_assign['people.csv']`, and once you're confident that you have your people file configured correctly with all exclusions, you can send the emails with `source .env && bundle exec rake email_assign['people.csv','email.txt']`.
